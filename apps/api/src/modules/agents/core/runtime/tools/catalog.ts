// The actions an internal agent can be given, surfaced to the config UI with
// human-readable labels. Two groups:
//
// - AGENT_ACTIONS: actions the user opts an agent into. The enabled subset is stored
//   in ai_agent.tools and becomes the tools the runtime exposes. Mutating actions
//   belong here; so do the note board reads, since notes are an optional feature.
// - ALWAYS_ON_ACTIONS: read-only actions always granted, so an agent can always see
//   its project regardless of which actions it is allowed to take. Listed only so
//   the UI can show them (always enabled, not editable); their keys are never
//   stored on the agent.
//
// Every key is the name of a route tagged with mcpTool() — the one exception is
// get_current_date, which has no route behind it (see tools/local.ts). What a tool
// accepts and who may call it come from the route itself (see tools/route-tools.ts);
// this file adds the allowlist, the UI copy, and the agent-only overrides (see
// ToolMeta.overrides). An agent's effective rights are the intersection of these keys
// and its project role.

// The feature an action belongs to, so the config UI can group the catalog.
